Objectives:
Design a Cryptocurrency Landing Page: Create a visually appealing landing page for a cryptocurrency platform. The design should be modern and professional, reflecting the dynamic world of digital finance.
Integrate a Real-Time Currency Converter: At the top of the landing page, implement a currency converter that allows users to check the equivalent value of different cryptocurrencies in real time. This will involve fetching data from a cryptocurrency API. You can use the API of your choice for the currency converter. The currency converter can either be crypto focused or a general API.
Ensure Full Responsiveness: The website must be fully responsive, providing an excellent user experience on devices of all sizes. Use JavaScript and CSS to enhance the layout and ensure it adapts smoothly to different screen resolutions.
API Integration: Research and utilize a reliable API to fetch real-time data for the currency converter. You are responsible for finding an API that provides accurate and timely cryptocurrency data.
Requirements:
HTML: Structure your website with clear, semantic HTML5 tags.
CSS: Style your website with CSS. You are encouraged to use frameworks like Bootstrap or utilities like Flexbox and Grid to aid in designing a responsive layout.
JavaScript: Use JavaScript for dynamic elements on the page, such as the currency converter. This should include error handling to manage any issues with API data fetching.
API: Select a currency API that allows you to pull real-time exchange rates. Ensure the API is free to use and has sufficient documentation.
